//A driver has to determine if they can make it across the desert with their current fuel.
// They are about to pass the last gas station for the next 200 miles,
// and they need to determine whether they should stop now for gas or not.

var carEfficiency;
var gaugeReading;
var tankCapacity;
var gallonsNeeded;

//Gas efficiency of the car (in mpg)
carEfficiency = 30 mpg;
//Gauge reading of the gas tank (in %)
gaugeReading = 7 gallons;
//Car’s gas tank capacity (in gallons)
tankCapacity = 12 gallons;
//Gallons needed to cross the desert
gallonsNeeded = 200 / 30

if(gaugeReading > gallonsNeeded){
    console.log("Yes, you can make it without stopping for gas!")
}









//“Yes, you can make it without stopping for gas!”
// or “You only have X gallons of gas in your tank, better get gas now while you can!”
